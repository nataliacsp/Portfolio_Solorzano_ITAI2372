# Summary: Estonia’s AI Judge

This case study explored how Estonia implemented an AI-powered judicial assistant named "Justi" to resolve small civil claims under €7,000. Justi uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret documents and deliver rulings quickly, helping reduce backlog and restore public trust in the justice system.

Key focus areas included:
- Automation in legal decision-making
- Reducing bias and fatigue in small claims courts
- Ethical concerns around fairness and transparency

Tools & Concepts: NLP, AI ethics, e-governance
